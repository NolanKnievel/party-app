# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This iOS app is a pass-the-phone style party game that combines the excitement of a spinning wheel player selector with customizable question decks. Players enter their names, spin a wheel to determine who gets the phone, answer questions from various decks (including default and user-generated content), and pass the phone back for the next spin. The app emphasizes simplicity, visual appeal, and community-driven content creation.
